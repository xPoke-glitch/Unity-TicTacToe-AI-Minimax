## Requirements

If you only want to run the application and play:
 - Windows 64bit

If you want to open, edit or see the Unity project:
 - Unity 2020.1.1f1 (or greater)
 - You can use Unity versions before the 2020.1.1f1 but errors may will occur

## Get the Unity project

Download the project and open it using Unity Hub with the recommended Unity version **2020.1.1f1** (or greater)

## Run the app

In order to only play the game, you can download the project and go to: **TIC_TAC_TOE_AI > Builds** and run the application: **TIC_TAC_TOE_AI.exe**

Eventually if you opened it with Unity, you can directly test it in the Unity Editor or you can build it yourself.
